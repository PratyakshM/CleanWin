# Contribution

WinRice accepts all kinds of contributions such as finding bugs, fixing bugs, adding features, removal of deprecated features and/or values, improving documentation, etc. I'm excited to work with the users and fellow PowerShell enthusiasts to further improve this project.

I ask that **before you start your work on a feature that you would like to request or contribute**, please read the WinRice [principles](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/wiki/Principles). I will be happy to work with you to figure out good approaches and provide guidance throughout feature development, and help avoid any wasted or duplicated effort.
