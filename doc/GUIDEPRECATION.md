# CleanWin GUI Deprecation notice

CleanWin GUI has been fully deprecated and is now in its [archived state](https://github.com/pratyakshm/CleanWin/tree/archive).
The core reason behind this is that CleanWin GUI was dependent on decades old and now deprecated Windows Forms technology.
The CleanWin GUI mostly was not a good experience - either for me as a dev or for the users.
In lieu of this change, CleanWin now only has one variant (i.e. CLI), hence its just called CleanWin.

## Features affected  
### **App Uninstaller [PORTED to CLI]**  
This feature has been ported to regular CleanWin. When run, users will have a choice to uninstall apps using CLI or GUI.    
While the CLI app uninstaller will remove apps as documented in [`TASKS.md`](https://github.com/pratyakshm/CleanWin/blob/main/doc/TASKS.md), GUI app uninstaller will give users the choice over which apps they want to uninstall.
