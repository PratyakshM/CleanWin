# Contribution

WinRice accepts all kinds of contributions such as finding bugs, fixing bugs, adding features, removal of deprecated features and/or values, improving documentation, etc. I'm excited to work with the users and fellow PowerShell enthusiasts to further improve this project.

I ask that **before you start your work on a feature that you would like to request or contribute**, please read the WinRice principles below. I will be happy to work with you to figure out good approaches and provide guidance throughout feature development, and help avoid any wasted or duplicated effort.

## Principles

1. Prefer usage of first party software over third party software (instance: WinGet over Chocolatey, etc.).
2. Avoid removing software which is tied to the operating sytem (e.g. Microsoft Edge).
3. Avoid removing software that is unrecoverable.
4. Avoid removing developer category inbox apps (e.g. Windows Terminal).
5. Avoid removing media playback apps (e.g. Media Player, Movies & TV, Photos, etc.).
6. Avoid removing Xbox sister apps (e.g. Xbox Game bar, etc.).
7. Avoid removing software which when removed might result in reduced OS and app functionality.
8. Avoid modifying settings or files that might result in negative conflicts with Windows Update.
9. Avoid making changes that might result in a degraded OS security and/or stability.
10. Avoid adding registry edits that no longer take effect in [currently serviced Windows 11/10 versions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/release-information).
