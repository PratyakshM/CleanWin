# Winstall
## This document guides users on how to use Winstall.

***

### CleanWin lets you install your own set of apps that you use, using a text file.
âš  Winstall depends on '[WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli)' dependency. 
### Installing WinGet
- **Install WinGet** button in CleanWin GUI.
- Download and install the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases/latest).

### Creating the file Winstall.txt
Create a new text file using any text editor, and add app names separated by a new line.  
Remember, Winstall text file must be saved in the same location as CleanWin.
You may use ``pwd`` to find your current location in terminal.
&nbsp;

### Examples
- This syntax installs Firefox, Visual Studio Code, Windows Terminal and 7zip:
```
Firefox
Visual Studio Code
Windows Terminal
7zip
```
Just like this, you can install any app you want by just writing its name in Winstall.txt
