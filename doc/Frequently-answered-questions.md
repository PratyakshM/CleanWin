**Q:** **Where can I read the detailed documentation for WinRice?**  
**A:** If you are a user, chances are that the [`doc`](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/tree/main/doc) folder has what you need.   
Otherwise, you may want to check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/wiki).

**Q:** **Is there a document that details what each function performs?**

**Q:** **Please add &lt;feature&gt; to WinRice**   
**A:** Submit a [Pull request](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/pulls) with your code or create an [Issue](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/issues). As long as it follows WinRice [principles](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/wiki/Principles) and adds value, I will most likely make it happen.

**Q:** **How is WinRice tested?**  
**A:** WinRice is only tested in the OS builds listed in [`Windows version`](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice#windows-version) section of README placed in this project's root directory. 

**Q:** **I opted to turn off automatic Windows updates, but they're not turned off. Why?**   
**A:** Editions based on Windows Core, for instance Windwos 10 Home, do not support setting up group policies, hence WinRice can't setup Windows Update policies in these editions.   
If WinRice has not set up group policies despite your edition of Windows supporting it, please consider filing a [bug report](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/issues/new?assignees=pratyakshm&labels=Issue-Bug&template=bug_report.yaml&title=Bug%3A+).
