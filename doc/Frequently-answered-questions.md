**Q:** **Please add &lt;feature&gt; to WinRice**  
**A:** Submit a [Pull request](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/pulls) with your code or create an [Issue](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/issues). As long as it follows the WinRice [principles](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/wiki/Principles) and adds value, I will most likely make it happen.

**Q:** **How is WinRice tested?**  
**A:** WinRice is only tested in the Windows versions listed in [`Supported OS versions`](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice#supported-os-versions) section of the main README.

**Q:** **I opted to turn off automatic Windows updates, but they're not turned off. Why?**  
**A:** Editions based on Windows Core, Windwos 10 Home for instance, do not support setting up group policies. Hence, WinRice can't setup Windows Update policies in these editions.
If WinRice has not set up group policies despite your edition of Windows supporting it, please consider filing a [bug report](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/issues/new?assignees=pratyakshm&labels=Issue-Bug&template=bug_report.yaml&title=Bug%3A+).
