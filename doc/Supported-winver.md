## How to check if my device is compatible?

1. Open Windows **Settings**.

2. Navigate to **System > About**.

3. Find the **Windows specifications** section.

4. Verify that either the **Version** or the **OS Build** displayed are listed in the table above.

P.S.: If you are a Windows Insider, you may skip checking for compatibility since WinRice is always updated to support the latest Insider builds.

## Notes

üì¢ Data provided in this table is extrapolated from [Microsoft's release health document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/) for [Windows 11](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information) and [Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/release-information). This is to say, as soon as a Windows version reaches end of servicing for consumer / client editions, WinRice subsequently drops support for it.

‚ö†Ô∏è If the Version and OS build that you see are **NOT** listed in the table above, the version of Windows that your device is running has reached End of servicing which means that your device is no longer receiving security updates and it is vulnerable to attacks. In such a scenario, you need to [update your device](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-windows-3c5ae7fc-9fb6-9af1-1984-b5e0412c556a) to the latest version of Windows. If you want to re-install Windows (strongly recommended), [click here to learn more.](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/wiki/Fresh-installation-of-Windows).
