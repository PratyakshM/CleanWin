📢 Data provided in this table is extrapolated from [Microsoft's release health document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/) for [Windows 11](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information) and [Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/release-information). This is to say, as soon as a Windows version reaches end of servicing, WinRice will consecutively drop support for that Windows version.

⚠️ WinRice also supports Windows Insider builds. It is being continually updated to align with the most recent changes in Windows Insider builds while maintaining compatibility for released versions of Windows. 

## How to check if my device is compatible?
Go to **Settings > System > About** and scroll down to the **Windows specifications** section.
In here, check out **Version** and **OS build** and verify if its listed in the table provided above.
  
If the Version and OS build that you see are **NOT** listed in the table above, the version of Windows that your device is running has reached End of servicing which means that your device is no longer receiving security updates and it is vulnerable to attacks. In such a scenario, you need to [update your device](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-windows-3c5ae7fc-9fb6-9af1-1984-b5e0412c556a) to the latest version of Windows.
