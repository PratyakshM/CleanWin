# Supported Windows OS Versions

WinRice supports the latest in-service versions of Windows. However, bug reports are only accepted for the two most recent in-service versions of Windows 11 and the most recent version of Windows 10.

## Check compatibility

1. Open Start menu, type "About your PC" and open the first search result.

2. Take a note of the **Version** under Windows specifications.

3. Check if the Version you have is mentioned in the **Servicing channels** table of the release information document for either [Windows 11](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information) or [Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/release-information), depending on which one you're using.

## Notes

- When a Windows version stops receiving updates for consumer editions, WinRice also stops supporting it.

- If you do not see your Version listed under the Servicing channels category for your respective OS, it means that it has likely reached end of servicing and [requires an update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-windows-3c5ae7fc-9fb6-9af1-1984-b5e0412c556a).

- If you wish to re-image your device (which is strongly recommended if you're on an older version or if you want the full WinRice experience), please [refer to this document](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/wiki/Fresh-installation-of-Windows).
