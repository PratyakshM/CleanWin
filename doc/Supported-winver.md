⚠️ This table does not include builds from Windows Insider Program. But if you are a Windows Insider, you can still run WinRice provided you're on a recent build.

The table provided above is in sync with the **in service** OS builds maintained in [this site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/release-information). This means, as soon as a build reaches End of service, WinRice drops support for that build.
  
## How to check if my device is compatible?
Go to **Settings > System > About** and scroll down to the **Windows specifications** section.
In here, check out **Version** and **OS build** and verify if its listed in the table provided above.
  
If the Version and OS build that you are currently on are **NOT** listed in the table above, you need to update your device. [Learn more](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/wiki/Fresh-installation-of-Windows).
