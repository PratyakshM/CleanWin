**Q:** **How do I revert a change?**  
**A:** For every change, there is also a corresponding function which restores the default settings. The default is considered freshly installed Windows 10 with no adjustments made during or after the installation. Pick the concerned code and paste it on elevated PowerShell. Optionally, you might need to restart your PC (depends on what change you made) for the change to take effect.

**A:** Submit a [Pull request](https://github.com/pratyakshm/CleanWin/pulls) with your code or create an [Issue](https://github.com/pratyakshm/CleanWin/issues) describing the feature. When I have time, I will review the feature. I like it and it gets merged.

**Q:** **How is CleanWin tested?**  
**A:** Read [this statement](https://github.com/PratyakshM/CleanWin/wiki/Documentation#%EF%B8%8F-os-builds-compatibility).

**Q:** **I opted to turn off automatic Windows updates, but they're not turned off. Why?**   
**A:** This could be an issue if your edition of Windows is based on Windows Core (for instance, Windows 10 Home). If you're using an edition of Windows built on Windows Enterprise (for instance, Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Enterprise, etc.) and the feature stil doesn't seem to take effect, please create an [Issue](https://github.com/pratyakshm/CleanWin/issues).
