# Notes

This folder mostly has documentation for users.   
For **all** docs, check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/wiki).

## Found an issue with docs?
Report them. Report any issues you face while reading the documentation. Be it spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, or just unclear language.   
### [Submit an issue](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/issues/new?assignees=pratyakshm&labels=Issue-Docs&template=doc_issue.yaml&title=Docs+issue%3A+), make it as detailed as possible.

## Refrain from using WinRice if you have NOT read the documentation
WinRice might cause unwanted changes to your device given you have not read docs.  
Nobody likes users who ask stuff without reading docs. So don't be one.
