# Security

### Stay on lock screen post a Windows Update restart
After a device restarts after applying a Windows Update, it stays on the lock screen and awaits manual login from a user.

<!-- >
### Virtualization-based Security
Virtualization-based security, or VBS, uses hardware virtualization features to create and isolate a secure region of memory from the normal operating system. 
Virtualization-based security causes big performance impact in devices that do not support, amongst many other things, MBEC. In MBEC-unsupported devices, its behavior is emulated which causes the impact.

WinRice disables Virtualization-based security on MBEC-unsupported devices.

**Note:** Disabling Virtualization-based security results in loss of functionality of WSL and WSA as they are powered by Hyper-V. If you use WSL or WSA, you need to re-enable Virtualization-based security.

To enable, open Windows Terminal (Admin) and run this command:
```
Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/J9OZr'))
```
After running this command, restart your device to apply the changes.

### Windows WDigest Credential Caching

Digest Authentication is a challenge/response protocol that was primarily used in Windows Server 2003 for LDAP and web-based authentication. It utilizes Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Simple Authentication Security Layer (SASL) exchanges to authenticate. 

This is where WDigest comes into play, something to be concerned with related to WDigest is that it stores passwords in clear-text, in memory. If a malicious user has access to an endpoint and is able to run a tool like Mimikatz, not only would they get the hashes currently stored in memory, but they‚Äôd also be able to get the clear-text password for the accounts as well. 

WinRice disables WDigest Credential Caching on all devices.

See more at [What is Digest Authentication?: Logon and Authentication - docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc778868(v%3dws.10)).

### Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution
LLMNR was (is) a protocol used that allowed name resolution without the requirement of a DNS server. It was (is) able to provide a hostname-to-IP based off a multicast packet sent across the network asking all listening Network-Interfaces to reply if they are authoritatively known as the hostname in the query. 
Windows will use LLMNR in certain circumstances to identify certain machines on the network, such as file-servers. If Windows attempts to use LLMNR to identify the server of a file-share and it receives a reply, it will send the current user‚Äôs credentials directly to that server assuming it wouldn‚Äôt have replied if it wasn‚Äôt the authoritative file-server. If that LLMNR received response was actually an impersonator, Windows just disclosed that user‚Äôs credential hash to a third-party. What‚Äôs worse? The impersonator may forward that packet to the actual file-server, so the user never realizes anything is amiss.

WinRice disables LLMNR on all devices.

### Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection
This feature is designed to block exploits that use the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) overwrite technique. This protection mechanism is provided at run-time. Therefore, it helps protect your device. 

WinRice enables Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection on all devices.

See more at [How to enable Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP) in Windows operating systems - support.microsoft.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-to-enable-structured-exception-handling-overwrite-protection-sehop-in-windows-operating-systems-8d4595f7-827f-72ee-8c34-fa8e0fe7b915).

### Web Proxy Auto-Discovery

WPAD is a protocol, developed in 1999 by people from Microsoft and other technology companies, that allows computers to automatically discover which web proxy they should use. The proxy is defined in a JavaScript file called a proxy auto-config (PAC) file.

The location of PAC files can be discovered through WPAD in several ways: through a special Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) option, through local Domain Name System (DNS) lookups, or through Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR).

Attackers can abuse these options to supply computers on a local network with a PAC file that specifies a rogue web proxy under their control. This can be done on an open wireless network or if the attackers compromise a router or access point.

WinRice disables Web Proxy Auto-Discovery or WPAD on all devices.

See more at [Disable WPAD now or have your accounts and private data compromised - csoonline.com](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3106076/disable-wpad-now-or-have-your-accounts-and-private-data-compromised.html).

### Local Security Authority (LSA) Protection

The LSA, which includes the Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) process, validates users for local and remote sign-ins and enforces local security policies. The Windows 8.1 operating system provides additional protection for the LSA to prevent reading memory and code injection by non-protected processes. This provides added security for the credentials that the LSA stores and manages.

WinRice enables LSA Protection on all devices.

See more at [Configuring Additional LSA Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection)

### Windows Script Host

Numerous spam campaigns are pushing various crypto-ransomware families (and backdoors) via ZIP file attachments. And such ZIP files typically contain a JScript (.js/.jse) file which, if clicked, will be run via Windows Script Host.

Since Windows Script Host is also not used by personal PC users, WinRice disables this feature.

See more at [How-To Disable Windows Script Host - blog.f-secure.com](https://blog.f-secure.com/how-to-disable-windows-script-host/).

### Office OLE

OLE allows an editing application to export part of a document to another editing application and then import it with additional content. For example, a desktop publishing system might send some text to a word processor or a picture to a bitmap editor using OLE. 
OLE is misused by malware and is often treated by some as an exploit.

WinRice disables Office OLE.

## Notes

- WinRice sets your Diagnostic data to Required level. On devices running Windows pre-release software, Diagnostic data is set to Optional level.

- Error reporting is not disabled in Windows pre-release software.

- Feedback notifications are not disabled in Windows pre-release software.

- Windows Update policies are not applied in Windows pre-release software.

- Windows Update policies are only applied to Windows editions that support Group policies. These are Education, Enterprise, Enterprise LTSC and Professional editions. Windows editions that are derivates of Windows Core edition (for instance, Windows 11/10 Home) do not support Group policies, hence Windows Update policies cannot be applied to them.
