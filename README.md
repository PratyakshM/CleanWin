## Explain in one line 
Cool underrated code that sets up Windows.


## Ok - in all seriousness
Everything from removing junk (your hardware doesn't count, yet), cleaning up the Windows UI, setting up privacy policies, Windows Update policies, installing your own apps, disabling unnecessary features and enabling useful ones meanwhile retaining maximum app functionality. Sounds pretty cool, eh?
