## üòÉ Description
WinRice performs a bunch of tasks including (but not limited to) removing unused apps, installing useful apps (read [`winget.md`](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/blob/main/doc/WINGET.md#winrice-x-winget)), cleaning up the Windows UI, maximizing privacy, setting up Windows Update policies, configuring optional features, etc. - while retaining maximum OS stability and functionality.   


***

## ‚úîÔ∏è Prerequisites

### Windows Terminal  
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54220235/130347354-d4e7af6e-a153-4954-a7f4-3d7ad27da7c9.png" alt="Windows Terminal product page on Microsoft Store"></a>    

More installation methods include: 
   - Getting the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases)
   - Windows Package Manager CLI (winget): ``winget install --id=Microsoft.WindowsTerminal --source winget``   

### Supported OS versions
WinRice supports the latest retail and preview versions of Windows.  
To check if your device is compatible, go to **Settings > System > About** and scroll down to the **Windows specifications** section. Make sure that the **Version** or **OS Build** you are currently running is listed in the table below.  
| OS version | Version | OS Build | Servicing option |
| ----------- | --------- | -----------| ------------------ | 
| Windows 11 | Dev | 22000+ | Dev Channel |
| Windows 11 | 21H2 | 22000 | Beta and Release Preview Channels |
| Windows 10 | 21H1 | 19043 | Semi-Annual Channel |
| Windows 10 | 21H2 | 19044 | Release Preview Channel (SAC incoming) |
#### Note
   - Windows Pro edition or upwards (Enterprise, etc.) is strongly recommended.
   - If you are not running a supported OS version, you need to update your device. A fresh installation is even more recommended, and its easy: [Read the document](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/wiki/Fresh-installation-of-Windows)!
