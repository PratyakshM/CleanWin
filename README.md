## üòÉ Description

WinRice uses PowerShell automation to setup a Windows device. It currently supports only the latest retail builds of Windows 11 and 10.
  
WinRice, amongst a host of other things, improves privacy, de-clutters the Windows user interface and removes non-essential apps from Windows while still retaining OS functionality.
