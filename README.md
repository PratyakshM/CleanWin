### ðŸ’¡ Read documentation properly before running CleanWin


## Explain in one line 
Cool underrated code that sets up Windows.


## Ok - in all seriousness
Everything from removing junk (your hardware doesn't count, yet), cleaning up the Windows UI, setting up privacy policies, Windows Update policies, installing your own apps, disabling unnecessary features and enabling useful ones meanwhile retaining maximum app compatibility. Sounds pretty cool, eh?

### Can I revert changes? 
The answer is yes for the most part. Check Irreversible changes section of [this document](https://github.com/pratyakshm/CleanWin/wiki/Reverting-changes) to learn more.


## Running CleanWin
You can use either of the two following methods:
### 1. Main branch (recommended)
Open Windows Terminal as Administrator.  
To run **CLI** (based and redpilled), paste  
`Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JmqTS'))`   
Oh you wanna run **GUI** (cringe and bluepilled)? Paste    
`Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/Jqcr0'))`   

### 2. GitHub release
   It's simple - tap [this link](https://github.com/pratyakshm/CleanWin/releases/latest) to get to the latest release or browse all releases [here](https://github.com/pratyakshm/CleanWin/releases).

## Supported Windows OSes
CleanWin supports the most recent Windows 10 feature update: version 21H1 (OS Build 19043). Windows 11 support is experimental and I strongly suggest running code from main branch if you're using CleanWin on Windows 11.
