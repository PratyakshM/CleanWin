## üòÉ Description

WinRice performs a bunch of tasks including (but not limited to) removing unused apps, installing useful apps (read [`winget.md`](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/blob/main/doc/winget/winget.md#winrice-x-winget)), cleaning up the Windows UI, maximizing privacy, setting up Windows Update policies, configuring optional features, etc. - while retaining maximum OS stability and functionality.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Prerequisites

### Windows Terminal

<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54220235/130347354-d4e7af6e-a153-4954-a7f4-3d7ad27da7c9.png" alt="Windows Terminal product page on Microsoft Store"></a>

More installation methods include:

- Getting the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases)
- Windows Package Manager CLI (winget): `winget install --id=Microsoft.WindowsTerminal --source winget`

### Supported OS Versions

WinRice supports the latest Windows retail and pre-release builds.

‚ö†Ô∏è This table features builds from Windows retail channel (Production/General availability/ Release to manufacturing). Windows Insider channels are still supported but no longer featured in the list.

| OS Version | Version | OS Build | Servicing Option    |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| Windows 11 | 21H2    | 22000    | Annual Channel      |
| Windows 10 | 21H1    | 19043    | Semi-Annual Channel |

#### Notes

- To check if your device is compatible, go to **Settings > System > About** and scroll down to the **Windows specifications** section. Make sure that the **Version** or **OS Build** you are currently running is listed in the table above.
  - If you are not running a supported OS version, you need to update your device. A fresh installation is strongly recommended and is easy: [Read the document](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/wiki/Fresh-installation-of-Windows)!
- In case of Retail channel (GA/RTM), WinRice supports **only** the latest retail channel build. I could include support for older Retail (GA/RTM) builds but honestly, I do not have the time to test each change in more than two OS builds.

### Internet Connection

An active internet connection is needed.

WinRice accepts all kinds of contributions such as finding bugs, fixing bugs, adding features, removal of deprecated features and/or values, improving documentation, etc. I'm excited to work with the users and fellow PowerShell enthusiasts to further improve this project.

I ask that **before you start your work on a feature that you would like to request or contribute**, please read the WinRice [principles](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/wiki/Principles).
