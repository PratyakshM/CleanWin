## Brief
WinRice does everything from removing junk (your hardware doesn't count, yet), cleaning up the Windows UI, setting up privacy policies, Windows Update policies, disabling unnecessary features and enabling useful ones meanwhile retaining maximum app functionality. It also uses [`Winstall`](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice/blob/main/doc/WINSTALL.md) and [`winget import`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/import) to batch install apps you want. Sounds pretty cool, eh?
